# Node.js AWS Serverless Wish Keeper ☁️🧞‍✨

This project is a Node.js serverless application that accepts username and his/her/their wish, 
saves it in AWS DynamoDB using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, and returns the message of acceptance with the username.

## Project Structure 🗂

The project has the following structure:
<pre>
├── README.md
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── serverless.json
└── src
    └── handler.js
</pre>

* After installing all dependencies node_modules folder will appear as well.

## Getting Started 🚀

### If you want to recreate one like this application and learn along the way, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
Before running or deploying this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- AWS account and IAM credentials.
- Serverless Framework (installed globally). You can install it by running `npm install -g serverless`.


Follow the steps below to get started with the application:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Configure AWS credentials:

Set up your AWS IAM credentials by either configuring the AWS CLI using `aws configure` or setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

4. Update serverless.json:

Update the `serverless.json` file in the project root to customize the service name, region, and other settings as needed.

5. Deploy the application to AWS:
   ```bash
   sls deploy
   ```
   
6. Attach a policy to the Lambda function to allow writing in DynamoDB:
   ```bash 
   * Go to the AWS Management Console.
   * Navigate to the IAM service.
   * Find and select the IAM role associated with your Lambda function.
   * Attach the "AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess" policy to the IAM role.
   ```

7. Test the application:

Once the deployment is complete, you will see the API endpoints generated by API Gateway in the console output. Use the provided endpoints to test the application. 
For example, you can test via the terminal: 

   ```bash 
   % curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
      "username": "your username",
      "text": "your wish"
      }' "your API endpoint"
   ```
The application will save the username and text in DynamoDB and return the response with the username in it: 
### `${username} jan, your wish is my command.`

## Clean Up 🗑
If you want to remove the deployed AWS resources, you can run the following command:
   ```bash
      sls remove
   ```

This will delete the Lambda function, API Gateway, and DynamoDB table.
